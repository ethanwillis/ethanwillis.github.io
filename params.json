In 2013 I attained my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Memphis where I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Bioinformatics.\r\n\r\n## Software Development and Projects\r\nI develop a lot of software for various projects some public and some private. The bulk of my daily development is as the software architect for DanceCard LLC based out San Francisco, CA. As well I work full-time developing several applications to support clinical research projects at UTHSC in Memphis, TN in \r\n\r\n### DanceCard\r\nDanceCard is a next generation lead generation and analytics platform for the medical device industry. With guidance from my experienced CEO Colin Cook, we built this platform scratch. A quick overview of the features contained within this project are as follows:\r\n* Call Metadata recording.\r\n* Analytics Dashboard and Report Generation.\r\n* Call voicemail text to speech.\r\n* Integrations with various CRMs and tools such as Salesforce, Insightly, Google Analytics, PipeDrive CRM, Mandrill/Mailchimp.\r\n* Automated email based lead nurturing.\r\n* Virtual Call Center Service \r\n* Desktop, Web Application, and Mobile versions of application via Electron shell.\r\nFor more information about DanceCard, visit our [SpiraDigital](http://www.spiradigital.com/) spinoff for the Sinuplasty industry \r\n\r\n### Unity\r\nUnity is a project inspired by RedCap that is described as a \"Flexible data management system for the biomedical informatics community.\" More definitively Unity facilitates the digitization of records, forms, and data collection logic used by clinical researchers in biomedical informatics that is traditionally captured via paper forms. Built upon this idea additional facilities allow Unity to function as a long-haul data warehouse and collection platform for clinical research datasets. \r\nI took over the Unity project from the original developer Mark Sakauye, who is now a consultant for Deloitte. Currently I am in the process of modularizing Unity as a collection of microservices for various frontends(web, mobile, and desktops) and open APIs.

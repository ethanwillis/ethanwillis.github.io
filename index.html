<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

<p>I was born and raised in Memphis, TN where I currently work as a Software Architect at University of Tennessee Health Science <a href="https://www.uthsc.edu/research/research_resources/biomedical_informatics/staff.php">Center for Biomedical Informatics</a>. In 2013 I attained my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Memphis where I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Bioinformatics.</p>

<p>I develop a lot of software for various projects some public and some private. The bulk of my daily development is as the software architect for DanceCard LLC based out San Francisco, CA. As well I work full-time developing several applications to support clinical research projects at UTHSC in Memphis, TN.  </p>

<a id="unity" class="anchor" href="#unity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unity</h3>

<p>Unity is a project inspired by RedCap that is described as a "Flexible data management system for the biomedical informatics community." More definitively Unity facilitates the digitization of records, forms, and data collection logic used by clinical researchers in biomedical informatics that is traditionally captured via paper forms. Built upon this idea additional facilities allow Unity to function as a long-haul data warehouse and collection platform for clinical research datasets. 
I took over the Unity project from the original developer Mark Sakauye, who is now a consultant for Deloitte. Currently I am in the process of modularizing Unity as a collection of microservices for various frontends(web, mobile, and desktops) and open APIs. More can be learned about Unity at <a href="unity.uthsc.edu">unity.uthsc.edu</a></p>
